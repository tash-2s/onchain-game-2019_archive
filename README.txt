This repository contains the codebase for a fully on-chain incremental/idle game and its NFT. It comprises smart contracts written in Solidity and a web frontend developed in TypeScript.

I developed this project in stealth mode back in 2019. It was complete from a technical perspective, but I chose not to publish it due to issues with the game design.

Originally, this codebase was developed across two private repositories, but I've merged them into this single public repository for record.
